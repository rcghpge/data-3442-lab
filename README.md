## Development Environment Setup
There are several methods to setup your initial R environment. You can run R in a GUI via RStudio, VS Code, a Jupyter notebook via a web browser, or on the command line in Bash. For beginner-friendly RStudio, VS Code, or Jupyter notebooks is recommended.

## Bash Development Workflow
Install R:
```bash
sudo apt install r-base
```

Run R Console Environment:
```bash
R
```

Alternatively you can run an R workflow environment directly in Bash with the following commands:
```bash
# Create an R script
nano hello.R

# Run R script
Rscript hello.R
```
